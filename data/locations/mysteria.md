Whether rightly or wrongly, Mysteria is dubbed the Capital of Incartum. It is what most people would call an approxomation of Hell, if Hell was a nice holiday resort.

Mysteria is a hub of activity and is the central location for all players to meet and interact. It is a place of commerce, where players can buy and sell items, and a place of socialization, where players can meet and form parties, guilds, and alliances. It is also a place of learning, where players can train and improve their skills, and a place of entertainment, where players can participate in various activities, such as minigames, contests, and events.
