## Storyline

The many realms of the Afterlife, the Underworld, and even Hell itself make up the far-corners of Incartum, a plane of existence that houses other-worldly horrors beyond mortal comprehension. The realms are inhabited by the deceased, in a manner befitting the beliefs of the faithful, along with a dark and insidious force known as the Voidtide. The Voidtide is an ancient cosmic energy that oozes from the depths of a forbidden dimension, seeping into the realms and corrupting everything in its path. It is an entity of pure chaos and destruction, feeding on the essence of belief, of faith, and of death itself.


Many centuries ago, a group of powerful mages attempted to unlock the secrets of the cosmos and gain godlike powers, elevating themselves to rulers of their realm. In their hubris, they inadvertently ruptured the fabric of reality, unleashing the Voidtide upon the world. Since that cataclysmic event, the darkness has spread relentlessly, devouring the realms and twisting creatures into nightmarish abominations.


The Voidtide corrupts the very fabric of reality, warping landscapes, and distorting natural laws. It infects the minds of the weak-willed, driving them to madness and turning them into mindless minions. Its tendrils reach far and wide, seeking to consume all forms of life and death, and plunge the realms into eternal chaos.



## Game Synopsis

*We should, perhaps, first preface that this game contains a lot of foul language and is not intended for children.*


As players explore the game world, they will witness the devastating effects of the Voidtide firsthand. They will encounter its grotesque creations, from twisted beasts to corrupted spirits, all driven by the insatiable hunger of the cosmic force. The presence of the Voidtide is palpable, with regions tainted by its darkness becoming warped and treacherous.


To combat the Voidtide, players must delve into forbidden knowledge and seek out ancient relics that can counter its influence. They will need to gather allies and forge alliances, as the power of unity is the only hope against this malevolent force. Together, players will embark on perilous quests, face formidable challenges, and engage in epic battles to push back the encroaching darkness.


The Voidtide will constantly evolve and adapt, posing new threats and challenges as players progress. Its power grows stronger with every victory, requiring players to delve deeper into the mysteries of the realm and harness the forces of darkness, light and the arcane to combat the ever-looming shadow.


By introducing the Voidtide as the primary antagonist element, we will create a foreboding atmosphere and a sense of urgency for players to combat the encroaching darkness. The relentless nature of the Voidtide and its ever-present influence provide ample opportunities for engaging gameplay, cooperative experiences, and a deep exploration of the lore surrounding this sinister cosmic force and its role in the destruction of human-belief.
