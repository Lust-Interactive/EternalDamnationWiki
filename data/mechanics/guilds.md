Creating or joining a [Guild](https://eternal-damnation.com/guild.php) can be a very rewarding experience.

## Guild Creation

### Requirements
If a player chooses to create a guild, they must first meet some requriements:

- Be at least Level 15
- Not currently be in a Guild
- Have the minimum requirement of Gold to create the guild

### Emblems
Emblems are currently not enabled, but will make an appearance in a future patch.


## Guild Levels
By completing Guild Quests, players can earn Guild XP.

Guilds have Levels which are reached by earning Guild XP, which will enable the Guild Leader to select Guild Skills, advancing passive bonuses and allowing the activation of skills during Alliance War. Specific Skills also enable the Guild Storage and Guild Bank, allowing players with the correct permissions to withdraw and/or deposit items/gold for other players to use.


## Guild Quests
Guild Quests are a way for players to earn Guild XP and Gold for their Guild. These quests are available to all members of the Guild to aid in their completion. Players with the correct privileges can activate Guild Quests up to 3 times per day from a selection of available quests based on their Guild Level.


## Guild Skills
Skills:

- Increase Max Members (Levels 1 to 10)
- Enable Portal Contract

## Final Notes:
A separate Chat Tab is available for Guild Chat.

There are 6 Guilds managed by the system which players are able to join freely, or players can apply to join another player-controlled guild, or create their own.

Creating a Player-Controlled Guild costs the player 1,000g multiplied by the number of guilds already created. This means the first Player Guild will cost 6,000g to create.
