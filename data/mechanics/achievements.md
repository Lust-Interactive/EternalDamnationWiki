One method of keeping track on your progress in the game is through the use of [Achievements](https://eternal-damnation.com/achievements.php). These are in-game goals that, when completed, reward the player with various items, titles, and other bonuses. Achievements are divided into several categories, such as Exploration, Combat, Crafting, and Social, and are tracked in the player's journal. Players can view their progress, and the rewards for each achievement, by opening the journal and navigating to the Achievements tab.

## Achievement Types

There are several types of achievements available to players, each with its own unique requirements and rewards. Some achievements are earned through exploration, such as discovering new locations, while others are earned through combat, such as defeating a certain number of monsters. There are also achievements for crafting, socializing, and completing quests, as well as special achievements that are only available during certain events or holidays.

## Achievement Rewards

The rewards for completing achievements vary depending on the type and difficulty of the achievement. Some achievements reward the player with items, such as weapons, armor, and trinkets, while others reward the player with titles, emotes, and other bonuses. There are also achievements that reward the player with currency, experience, and other resources, as well as special achievements that reward the player with unique items that cannot be obtained through any other means.

## Achievement Progress

Players can view their progress on achievements by opening the journal and navigating to the Achievements tab. Each achievement has a progress bar that shows the player's current progress, as well as the requirements for completing the achievement.

## Achievement Completion

When a player completes an achievement, they will receive a notification in the game world, as well as a reward in their inventory. Players can view their completed achievements by opening the journal and navigating to the Achievements tab, where they can see a list of all the achievements they have completed, as well as the rewards they have earned.
